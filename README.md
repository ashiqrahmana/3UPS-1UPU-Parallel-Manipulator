# 3UPS-1UPU-Parallel-Manipulator

The objective of this project is to design and develop a 3D printed robotic manipulator using the 3UPS-1UPU parallel mechanism. The manipulator will be powered by DC motors and will be designed to meet specific requirements in terms of load capacity, reach, degree of freedom, and speed.

The project will involve the following key aspects:

 * **Design and Fabrication**: A detailed design of the robotic manipulator will be created, taking into consideration the desired load capacity, reach, and speed. The design will incorporate the 3UPS-1UPU parallel mechanism, which consists of three universal prismatic spherical (UPS) joints and one universal prismatic universal (UPU) joint. The manipulator will be 3D printed using suitable materials to ensure its structural integrity and functionality.

 * **Load and Speed Testing**: The fabricated robotic manipulator will be subjected to load and speed tests to evaluate its performance. It will be tested under the designed load to ensure that it can carry the specified weight at the desired speed. Additionally, the manipulator will undergo a short-term test where it will carry 125% of the designed load at 125% of the designed speed, simulating slight overloads and over-speeding scenarios.

 * **Metrology and Accuracy Testing**: The manipulator's precision, resolution, and accuracy will be assessed using metrology equipment. The designed precession, resolution, and accuracy will be measured to verify if they meet the intended specifications. This step will ensure that the manipulator can perform precise tasks and maintain accuracy in its movements.

 * **Long-Term Performance Evaluation**: The manipulator will be tested for its prolonged operation over an extended period of time. The drift of accuracy of the system will be monitored and analyzed to understand how the manipulator's performance may change over time. This evaluation will help determine the system's reliability and stability for continuous operation.

**Hardware Used**: Teensy, Enocders

The outcomes of this project can have applications in various fields, including industrial automation, manufacturing processes, and research laboratories. The developed manipulator can be utilized for tasks such as material handling, pick-and-place operations, and precise positioning, contributing to increased efficiency and productivity in relevant domains.

By successfully completing this project, a reliable and high-performance 3UPS-1UPU parallel manipulator will be available for practical use, opening doors for further advancements and applications in the field of robotic manipulators.
